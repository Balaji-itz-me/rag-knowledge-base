What is ColBERT?
The name "ColBERT" stands for
Co
ntextualized
L
ate Interaction over
BERT
, a model stems from the Stanford University, that leverages the deep language understanding of BERT while introducing a novel interaction mechanism. This mechanism, known as
late interaction
, allows for efficient and precise retrieval by processing queries and documents separately until the final stages of the retrieval process. Specifically, there are two versions of the model:
ColBERT
: The initial model was the brainchild of
Omar Khattab
and Matei Zaharia
, presenting a novel approach to information retrieval through the "ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT" paper. Their work was published in SIGIR 2020.
ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT
Recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is driving fast-paced advances in Information Retrieval (IR), largely owed to fine-tuning deep language models (LMs) for document ranking. While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond reducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model, ColBERT’s pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large document collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT’s effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query.

Omar Khattab
continued his research, collaborating with
Barlas Oguz, Matei Zaharia, and Michael S. Bernstein
to introduce "ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction," presented at SIGIR 2021. This next iteration of ColBERT addressed previous limitations and introduced key improvements, such as

and
residual compression
, enhancing both the model's retrieval effectiveness and its storage efficiency.
ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction
Neural information retrieval (IR) has greatly advanced search and other knowledge-intensive language tasks. While many neural IR methods encode queries and documents into single-vector representations, late interaction models produce multi-vector representations at the granularity of each token and decompose relevance modeling into scalable token-level computations. This decomposition has been shown to make late interaction more effective, but it inflates the space footprint of these models by an order of magnitude. In this work, we introduce ColBERTv2, a retriever that couples an aggressive residual compression mechanism with a denoised supervision strategy to simultaneously improve the quality and space footprint of late interaction. We evaluate ColBERTv2 across a wide range of benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art quality within and outside the training domain while reducing the space footprint of late interaction models by 6--10

What is late interaction in ColBERT?
"Interaction" refers to the process of evaluating the relevance between a query and a document by comparing their representations.
"
Late interaction
" is the essence of ColBERT. The term is derived from the model's architecture and processing strategy, where the interaction between the query and document representations occurs late in the process, after both have been independently encoded. This contrasts with "
early interaction
" models, where query and document embeddings interact at earlier stages, typically before or during their encoding by the model.
Interaction Type
Models
Early Interaction
BERT, ANCE, DPR, Sentence-BERT, DRMM, KNRM, Conv-KNRM, etc.
Late Interaction
ColBERT, ColBERTv2
Early interaction can increase computational complexity since it requires considering all possible query-document pairs, making it less efficient for large-scale applications.
Late interaction models like ColBERT optimize for efficiency and scalability by allowing for the pre-computation of document representations and employing a more lightweight interaction step at the end, which focuses on the already encoded representations. This design choice enables faster retrieval times and reduced computational demands, making it more suitable for processing large document collections.

No interaction: cosine similarity of document and query embeddings
Many practical vector databases and neural search solutions depend on fast cosine similarity matching between document and query embeddings. While appealing for its straightforwardness and computational efficiency, this method, often referred to as "
no interaction
" or "
not interaction-based
" has been found to underperform in comparison to models that incorporate some form of interaction between queries and documents.
The core limitation of the "no interaction" approach lies in its inability to capture the complex nuances and relationships between query and document terms. Information retrieval, at its heart, is about understanding and matching the intent behind a query with the content within a document. This process often requires a deep, contextual understanding of the terms involved, something that single, aggregated embeddings for documents and queries struggle to provide.

Query and document encoders in ColBERT
ColBERT's encoding strategy is grounded in the BERT model, known for its deep contextual understanding of language. The model generates dense vector representations for each token in a query or document,
creating a bag of contextualized embeddings for a query and a bag for a document, respectively.
This facilitates a nuanced comparison of their embeddings during the late interaction phase.

Comparing ColBERT to cross-encoders
Cross-encoders process pairs of queries and documents together, making them highly accurate but less efficient for large-scale tasks due to the computational cost of evaluating every possible pair. They excel in specific scenarios where the precise scoring of sentence pairs is necessary, such as in semantic similarity tasks or detailed content comparison. However, this design limits their applicability in situations requiring rapid retrieval from large datasets, where pre-computed embeddings and efficient similarity calculations are paramount.
In contrast, ColBERT’s late interaction model allows for pre-computation of document embeddings, significantly speeding up the retrieval process without compromising the depth of semantic analysis. This method, though seemingly counter-intuitive when compared to the direct approach of cross-encoders, offers a scalable solution for real-time and large-scale information retrieval tasks. It represents a strategic compromise between computational efficiency and the quality of interaction modeling.
tag
Finding the top-K documents using ColBERT
Once we have embeddings for the query and documents, finding the most relevant top-K documents becomes straightforward (but not as straightforward as computing cosine of two vectors).
The key operations include a batch dot-product to compute term-wise similarities, max-pooling across document terms to find the highest similarity per query term, and summation across query terms to derive the total document score, followed by sorting the documents based on these scores. The pseudo PyTorch code is described below:
import
torch
def
compute_relevance_scores
(
query_embeddings, document_embeddings, k
):
"""
    Compute relevance scores for top-k documents given a query.
    
    :param query_embeddings: Tensor representing the query embeddings, shape: [num_query_terms, embedding_dim]
    :param document_embeddings: Tensor representing embeddings for k documents, shape: [k, max_doc_length, embedding_dim]
    :param k: Number of top documents to re-rank
    :return: Sorted document indices based on their relevance scores
    """
# Ensure document_embeddings is a 3D tensor: [k, max_doc_length, embedding_dim]
# Pad the k documents to their maximum length for batch operations
# Note: Assuming document_embeddings is already padded and moved to GPU
# Compute batch dot-product of Eq (query embeddings) and D (document embeddings)
# Resulting shape: [k, num_query_terms, max_doc_length]
scores = torch.matmul(query_embeddings.unsqueeze(
0
), document_embeddings.transpose(
1
,
2
))
# Apply max-pooling across document terms (dim=2) to find the max similarity per query term
# Shape after max-pool: [k, num_query_terms]
max_scores_per_query_term = scores.

# Sum the scores across query terms to get the total score for each document
# Shape after sum: [k]

# Sort the documents based on their total scores

Denoised supervision in ColBERTv2
Denoised supervision in ColBERTv2 refines the original training process by selecting challenging negatives and leveraging a cross-encoder for distillation. This sophisticated method of augmenting training data quality involves several steps:
Initial Training
: Utilizing the official triples from the MS MARCO dataset, comprising a query, a relevant document, and a non-relevant document.
Indexing and Retrieval
: Employing ColBERTv2's compression to index training passages, followed by retrieving top-k passages for each query.
Cross-Encoder Reranking
: Enhancing passage selection through reranking by a MiniLM cross-encoder, distilling its scores into ColBERTv2.
Forming Training Tuples
: Generating w-way tuples for training, incorporating both high and lower-ranked passages to create challenging examples.
Iterative Refinement
: Repeating the process to continually improve the selection of hard negatives, thereby enhancing model performance.
Note, this process represents a sophisticated enhancement to the ColBERT training regime rather than a fundamental change to its architecture.

The indexing strategy of ColBERT
Unlike representation-based approaches that encode each document into one embedding vector,
ColBERT encodes documents (and queries) into bags of embeddings, with each token in a document having its own embedding.
This approach inherently means that for longer documents, more embeddings will be stored,
which is a pain point of  the original ColBERT, and later addressed by ColBERTv2.
The key to managing this efficiently lies in ColBERT's use of vector database (e.g.
FAISS
) for indexing and retrieval, and its detailed indexing process which is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently. The original ColBERT paper mentions several strategies to enhance the efficiency of indexing and retrieval, including:
Offline Indexing
: Document representations are computed offline, allowing for the pre-computation and storage of document embeddings. This process leverages batch processing and GPU acceleration to handle large document collections efficiently.
Embedding Storage
: Document embeddings can be stored using 32-bit or 16-bit values for each dimension, offering a trade-off between precision and storage requirements. This flexibility allows ColBERT to maintain a balance between effectiveness (in terms of retrieval performance) and efficiency (in terms of storage and computational costs).
The introduction of
residual compression
in ColBERTv2, which is a novel approach not present in the original ColBERT, plays a key role in reducing the model's space footprint by 6–10× while preserving quality. This technique compresses the embeddings further by effectively capturing and storing only the differences from a set of fixed reference centroids.
tag
Effectiveness and Efficiency of ColBERT
One might initially assume that incorporating BERT's deep contextual understanding into search would inherently require significant computational resources, making such an approach less feasible for real-time applications due to high latency and computational costs. However, ColBERT challenges and overturns this assumption through its innovative use of the late interaction mechanism. Here are some noteworthy points:
Significant Efficiency Gains
: ColBERT achieves an orders-of-magnitude reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and latency compared to traditional BERT-based ranking models. Specifically, for a given model size (e.g., 12-layer "base" transformer encoder), ColBERT not only matches but in some cases exceeds the effectiveness of BERT-based models with dramatically lower computational demands. For instance, at a re-ranking depth of
k
=10, BERT requires nearly 180× more FLOPs than ColBERT; this gap widens as
k
increases, reaching 13900× at
k
=1000 and even 23000× at
k
=2000​​.
Improved Recall and MRR@10 in End-to-End Retrieval
: Contrary to the initial intuition that deeper interaction between query and document representations (as seen in early interaction models) would be necessary for high retrieval performance, ColBERT's end-to-end retrieval setup demonstrates superior effectiveness. For example, its Recall@50 exceeds the official BM25's Recall@1000 and almost all other models' Recall@200, underscoring the model's remarkable ability to retrieve relevant documents from a vast collection without direct comparison of each query-document pair​​.
Practicality for Real-World Applications
: The experimental results underline ColBERT's practical applicability for real-world scenarios. Its indexing throughput and memory efficiency make it suitable for indexing large document collections like MS MARCO within a few hours, retaining high effectiveness with a manageable space footprint. These qualities highlight ColBERT's suitability for deployment in production environments where both performance and computational efficiency are paramount​​.
Scalability with Document Collection Size
: Perhaps the most surprising conclusion is ColBERT's scalability and efficiency in handling large-scale document collections. The architecture allows for the pre-computation of document embeddings and leverages efficient batch processing for query-document interaction, enabling the system to scale effectively with the size of the document collection. This scalability is counter-intuitive when considering the complexity and depth of understanding required for effective document retrieval, showcasing ColBERT's innovative approach to balancing computational efficiency with retrieval effectiveness.
